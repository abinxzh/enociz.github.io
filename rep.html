            It&#x27;s a tough year to be starting as a med student! We&#x27;ve got COVID in our face, and have already faced so many challenges in getting used to the way we function. But, through it all, I&#x27;ve been there for you, whether that be as someone you can message to answer a burning question, someone who can hit up Richard and his voodoo dolls on your behalf, or <strong>co-founding and maintaining the one, and only, </strong><a href="http://med24.xyz"><strong>med24.xyz</strong></a>. As Academic Representative, I&#x27;ll take that into the next level! Check out some of my policies to find out what you can expect.

                  As an academic representative, I'll have the capacity to leverage the official role to access MUMUS and faculty resources. The website will be able to have the most up-to-date information, triple checked by the wonderful Richard himself, with handy tips from older students to help you make the most of your time. These changes will help you feel at ease and allow you to focus more of your time on becoming the best doctor you can!

                  Medicine at Monash is awesome because of all the cool things that our students put on. However, with all the lectures, help sessions, PSPs, MUMUS events, clubs, and more, it can be very hard for students to keep up. As academic representative, I'd implement calendars that you can subscribe to on Google Calendar, which will be kept up to date with classes (until COVID is done), assignment due dates, PSP dates, and key events that you, as Yr 1s, can be involved in.

                  With the onslaught that COVID has brought, a lot of us have been left out. While the social side of things is mostly something for our good friend, the social representative, to sort out, the academic side also needs to be tended to! I will run smaller, more focused revision sessions, with the help of the 2nd years, to focus on major pain points for our cohort; I will organise for online (and later in person) history-taking practice sessions between us, with some helpful advice from those older than us who have had the experience with OCEs that we have not yet had; and most importantly, I will support the formation of study groups, where you can revise with others and make friends, building relationships that will hopefully last well beyond preclinical years.

                  Our cohort is awesome because a lot of us are very vocal, but that makes it very easy to sit back into that desk and let a few people run things. Advocacy is a great passion of mine, and I believe that each and every one of you has something to contribute to make our time here better. As academic representative, I will set up a group with representatives from each of your ICL groups who can relay on information and complaints. It is these people who will let me (and the voodoo dolls) know about Zooms not running, slides not being posted. But not only that, they will be trusted friends who you can take your concerns to and who you can rely on to pass them on. I will also set up an anonymous feedback form for you to voice your concerns, which will be worked through by the group and taken to MUMUS and to the faculty so that you can have the best year possible.

            I'm involved with AMSA's MedEd group, which has a specific focus on improving the nature of education in medicine and so know how to contribute to Faculty committees to effectively communicate our concerns; I'm your first year representative for MUSIG (Monash University Surgical Interest Group); I've already shown that I can provide for your needs in running <a href="//med24.xyz">med24.xyz</a> and being someone you can go to for answers; I've organised our BBQ, the famed Potluck Picnic And Parté, and for some of you, have been organising our attendance at medical talks and events to nurture our passion for the field. I look forward to continuing to do all this, and more, as Academic Representative!
